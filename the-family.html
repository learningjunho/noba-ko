Croft와 그녀의 동료들(2014)은 300명 이상의 어린이들의 신념을 조사했습니다. 연구진은 아버지가 가사를 공평하게 분담하고 어머니가 직장 지향적일수록 딸의 사고방식에 영향을 미친다는 사실을 발견했습니다. 두 경우 모두 딸은 집 밖에서 일하고 성역할 고정관념이 덜한 직종에서 일하고 싶다는 야망을 가질 가능성이 더 높았습니다.</p><h1 id="how-families-develop">How Families Develop</h1><p>가족은 우리에게 너무 친숙해서 시간이 지남에 따라 가족이 발전한다는 생각을 당연하게 여길 때가 있습니다. 부모와 자녀로 구성된 핵심 단위인 핵가족은 단순히 생겨난 것이 아닙니다. 부모가 서로 만나고, 서로 구애하거나 데이트하고, 자녀를 갖기로 결정합니다. 그 후에도 가족은 변화를 멈추지 않습니다. 자녀가 성장하여 집을 떠나면 또다시 역할이 바뀌게 됩니다. </p><h2 id="intimacy">Intimacy</h2><figure data-align="left"><img loading="lazy" title="A man and woman in a tender embrace smile with eyes closed." src="https://nobaproject.com/images/shared/images/000/002/491/original.jpg" alt="A man and woman in a tender embrace smile with eyes closed." data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>According to Attachment Theory, the type of care that we receive as infants can have a significant influence on the intimate relationships that we have as adults.

It isn’t easy, but it is possible for anyone to “recover” a secure attachment. The process often requires the help of a supportive and dependable other, and for the insecure person to achieve <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-coherence" data-term="coherence" data-original-title="">coherence</a>—the realization that his or her upbringing is not a permanent reflection of character or a reflection of the world at large, nor does it bar him or her from being worthy of love or others of being trustworthy (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-50" data-reference="50" data-original-title="">Treboux, Crowell, &amp; Waters, 2004</a>).</p><h2 id="dating-courtship-and-cohabitation">Dating, Courtship, and Cohabitation</h2><p>Over time, the process of finding a mate has changed dramatically. In Victorian England, for instance, young women in high society trained for years in the arts—to sing, play music, dance, compose verse, etc. These skills were thought to be vital to the courtship ritual—a demonstration of feminine worthiness. Once a woman was of marriageable age, she would attend dances and other public events as a means of displaying her availability. A young couple interested in one another would find opportunities to spend time together, such as taking a walk. That era had very different dating practices from today, in which teenagers have more freedom, more privacy, and can date more people.</p><p>One major difference in the way people find a mate these days is the way we use technology to both expand and restrict the <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-marriage-market" data-term="marriage-market" data-original-title="">marriage market</a>—the process by which potential mates compare assets and liabilities of available prospects and choose the best option (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-6" data-reference="6" data-original-title="">Benokraitis, 2015</a>). Comparing marriage to a market might sound unromantic, but think of it as a way to illustrate how people seek out attractive qualities in a mate. Modern technology has allowed us to expand our “market” by allowing us to search for potential partners all over the world—as opposed to the days when people mostly relied on local dating pools. Technology also allows us to filter out undesirable (albeit available) prospects at the outset, based on factors such as shared interests, age, and other features.</p><p>The use of filters to find the most desirable partner is a common practice, resulting in people marrying others very similar to themselves—a concept called <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-homogamy" data-term="homogamy" data-original-title="">homogamy</a>; the opposite is known as <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-heterogamy" data-term="heterogamy" data-original-title="">heterogamy</a> (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-10" data-reference="10" data-original-title=""></a><a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-11" data-reference="11" data-original-title="">Burgess &amp; Wallin, 1943</a>). In his comparison of educational homogamy in 55 countries, Smits (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-46" data-reference="46" data-original-title="">2003</a>) found strong support for higher-educated people marrying other highly educated people. As such, education appears to be a strong filter people use to help them select a mate. The most common filters we use—or, put another way, the characteristics we focus on most in potential mates—are age, race, social status, and religion (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-43" data-reference="43" data-original-title="">Regan, 2008</a>). Other filters we use include compatibility, physical attractiveness (we tend to pick people who are as attractive as we are), and proximity (for practical reasons, we often pick people close to us) (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-27" data-reference="27" data-original-title="">Klenke-Hamel &amp; Janda, 1980</a>).</p><p>In many countries, technology is increasingly used to help single people find each other, and this may be especially true of older adults who are divorced or widowed, as there are few societally-structured activities for older singles. For example, younger people in school are usually surrounded with many potential dating partners of a similar age and background. As we get older, this is less true, as we focus on our careers and find ourselves surrounded by co-workers of various ages, marital statuses, and backgrounds. </p><figure data-align="left"><img loading="lazy" title="A young couple posing for wedding photos in traditional Indian attire." src="https://nobaproject.com/images/shared/images/000/002/492/original.jpg" alt="A young couple posing for wedding photos in traditional Indian attire." data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>In some countries, many people are coupled and committed to marriage through arrangements made by parents or professional marriage brokers.

For example, the Shanghai Marriage Market refers to the People’s Park in Shanghai, China—a place where parents of unmarried adults meet on weekends to trade information about their children in attempts to find suitable spouses for them (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-7" data-reference="7" data-original-title="">Bolsover, 2011</a>). In India, the marriage market refers to the use of marriage brokers or marriage bureaus to pair eligible singles together (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-51" data-reference="51" data-original-title="">Trivedi, 2013</a>). To many Westerners, the idea of arranged marriage can seem puzzling. It can appear to take the romance out of the equation and violate values about personal freedom. On the other hand, some people in favor of arranged marriage argue that parents are able to make more mature decisions than young people.</p><p>While such intrusions may seem inappropriate based on your upbringing, for many people of the world such help is expected, even appreciated. In India for example, “parental arranged marriages are largely preferred to other forms of marital choices” (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-44" data-reference="44" data-original-title="">Ramsheena &amp; Gundemeda, 2015</a>, p. 138). Of course, one’s religious and social caste plays a role in determining how involved family may be.</p><p>In terms of other notable shifts in attitude seen around the world, an increase in cohabitation has been documented. <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-cohabitation" data-term="cohabitation" data-original-title="">Cohabitation</a> is defined as an arrangement in which two people who are romantically live together even though they are not married (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-41" data-reference="41" data-original-title="">Prinz, 1995</a>). Cohabitation is common in many countries, with the Scandinavian nations of Iceland, Sweden, and Norway reporting the highest percentages, and more traditional countries like India, China, and Japan reporting low percentages (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-18" data-reference="18" data-original-title="">DeRose, 2011</a>). In countries where cohabitation is increasingly common, there has been speculation as to whether or not cohabitation is now part of the natural developmental progression of romantic relationships: dating and courtship, then cohabitation, engagement, and finally marriage. Though, while many cohabitating arrangements ultimately lead to marriage, many do not.</p><h2 id="engagement-and-marriage">Engagement and Marriage</h2><figure data-align="right"><img loading="lazy" title="A bride and bride dressed in traditional white wedding gowns hold bouquets of flowers and smile for photos after a wedding ceremony." src="https://nobaproject.com/images/shared/images/000/002/493/original.jpg" alt="A bride and bride dressed in traditional white wedding gowns hold bouquets of flowers and smile for photos after a wedding ceremony." data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>While marriage is common across cultures, the details such as “How” and “When” are often quite different.

In the majority of countries, 80% of men and women have been married by the age of 49 (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-52" data-reference="52" data-original-title="">United Nations, 2013</a>). Despite how common marriage remains, it has undergone some interesting shifts in recent times. Around the world, people are tending to get married later in life or, increasingly, not at all. People in more developed countries (e.g., Nordic and Western Europe), for instance, marry later in life—at an average age of 30 years. This is very different than, for example, the economically developing country of Afghanistan, which has one of the lowest average-age statistics for marriage—at 20.2 years (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-52" data-reference="52" data-original-title="">United Nations, 2013</a>). Another shift seen around the world is a gender gap in terms of age when people get married. In every country, men marry later than women. Since the 1970’s, the average age of marriage for women has increased from 21.8 to 24.7 years. Men have seen a similar increase in age at first marriage. </p><p>As illustrated, the courtship process can vary greatly around the world. So too can an <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-engagement" data-term="engagement" data-original-title="">engagement</a>—a formal agreement to get married. Some of these differences are small, such as on which hand an engagement ring is worn. In many countries it is worn on the left, but in Russia, Germany, Norway, and India, women wear their ring on their right. There are also more overt differences, such as who makes the proposal. In India and Pakistan, it is not uncommon for the family of the groom to propose to the family of the bride, with little to no involvement from the bride and groom themselves. In most Western industrialized countries, it is traditional for the male to propose to the female. What types of engagement traditions, practices, and rituals are common where you are from? How are they changing?</p><h2 id="children">Children?</h2><p>Do you want children? Do you already have children? Increasingly, families are postponing or not having children. Families that choose to forego having children are known as <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-childfree" data-term="childfree" data-original-title="">childfree</a> families, while families that want but are unable to conceive are referred to as <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-childless" data-term="childless" data-original-title="">childless</a> families. As more young people pursue their education and careers, age at first marriage has increased; similarly, so has the age at which people become parents. The average age for first-time mothers is 25 in the United States (up from 21 in 1970), 29.4 in Switzerland, and 29.2 in Japan (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-32" data-reference="32" data-original-title="">Matthews &amp; Hamilton, 2014</a>).</p><p>The decision to become a parent should not be taken lightly. There are positives and negatives associated with parenting that should be considered. Many parents report that having children increases their well-being (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-55" data-reference="55" data-original-title="">White &amp; Dolan, 2009</a>). Researchers have also found that parents, compared to their non-parent peers, are more positive about their lives (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-38" data-reference="38" data-original-title="">Nelson, Kushlev, English, Dunn, &amp; Lyubomirsky, 2013</a>). On the other hand, researchers have also found that parents, compared to non-parents, are more likely to be depressed, report lower levels of marital quality, and feel like their relationship with their partner is more businesslike than intimate (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-54" data-reference="54" data-original-title="">Walker, 2011</a>).</p><p>If you do become a parent, your parenting style will impact your child’s future success in romantic and parenting relationships. <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-authoritative-parenting" data-term="authoritative-parenting" data-original-title="">Authoritative</a> parenting, arguably the best parenting style, is both demanding and supportive of the child (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-29" data-reference="29" data-original-title="">Maccoby &amp; Martin, 1983</a>). Support refers to the amount of affection, acceptance, and warmth a parent provides. Demandingness refers to the degree a parent controls his/her child’s behavior. Children who have authoritative parents are generally happy, capable, and successful (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-30" data-reference="30" data-original-title="">Maccoby, 1992</a>). </p><figure data-align="full"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nobaproject.com/images/shared/images/000/002/031/original.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Table 2: Four parenting styles</figcaption></figure><p>Other, less advantageous parenting styles include authoritarian (in contrast to authorit<em>ative</em>), permissive, and uninvolved (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-49" data-reference="49" data-original-title="">Tavassolie, Dudding, Madigan, Thorvardarson, &amp; Winsler, 2016</a>). <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-authoritarian-parenting" data-term="authoritarian-parenting" data-original-title="">Authoritarian</a> parents are low in support and high in demandingness. Arguably, this is the parenting style used by Harry Potter’s harsh aunt and uncle, and Cinderella’s vindictive stepmother. Children who receive authoritarian parenting are more likely to be obedient and proficient, but score lower in happiness, social competence, and self-esteem. <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-permissive-parenting" data-term="permissive-parenting" data-original-title="">Permissive</a> parents are high in support and low in demandingness. Their children rank low in happiness and self-regulation, and are more likely to have problems with authority. <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-uninvolved-parenting" data-term="uninvolved-parenting" data-original-title="">Uninvolved</a> parents are low in both support and demandingness. Children of these parents tend to rank lowest across all life domains, lack self-control, have low self-esteem, and are less competent than their peers.</p><p>Support for the benefits of authoritative parenting has been found in countries as diverse as the Czech Republic (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-19" data-reference="19" data-original-title="">Dmitrieva, Chen, Greenberger, &amp; Gil-Rivas, 2004</a>), India (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-12" data-reference="12" data-original-title="">Carson, Chowdhurry, Perry, &amp; Pati, 1999</a>), China (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-40" data-reference="40" data-original-title="">Pilgrim, Luo, Urberg, &amp; Fang, 1999</a>), Israel (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-33" data-reference="33" data-original-title="">Mayseless, Scharf, &amp; Sholt, 2003</a>), and Palestine (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-42" data-reference="42" data-original-title="">Punamaki, Qouta, &amp; Sarraj, 1997</a>). In fact, authoritative parenting appears to be superior in Western, individualistic societies—so much so that some people have argued that there is no longer a need to study it (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-48" data-reference="48" data-original-title="">Steinberg, 2001</a>). Other researchers are less certain about the superiority of authoritative parenting and point to differences in cultural values and beliefs. For example, while many European-American children do poorly with too much strictness (authorit<em>arian</em> parenting), Chinese children often do well, especially academically. The reason for this likely stems from Chinese culture viewing strictness in parenting as related to training, which is not central to American parenting (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-13" data-reference="13" data-original-title="">Chao, 1994</a>).</p><h2 id="parenting-in-later-life">Parenting in Later Life</h2><p>Just because children grow up does not mean their family stops being a family. The concept of family persists across the entire lifespan, but the specific roles and expectations of its members change over time. One major change comes when a child reaches adulthood and moves away. When exactly children leave home varies greatly depending on societal norms and expectations, as well as on economic conditions such as employment opportunities and affordable housing options. Some parents may experience sadness when their adult children leave the home—a situation known as <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-empty-nest" data-term="empty-nest" data-original-title="">Empty Nest</a>. </p><figure data-align="left"><img loading="lazy" title="A family photo of four generations of men from great grandfather to great grandson." src="https://nobaproject.com/images/shared/images/000/002/494/original.jpg" alt="A family photo of four generations of men from great grandfather to great grandson." data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>When one’s children reach adulthood it doesn’t mean that parenting stops. Boomerang kids and multigenerational households that include aging parents are increasingly common. [Image: davidmulder61, http://goo.gl/eGPT5i, CC BY-SA 2.0, http://goo.gl/S6i0RI]</figcaption></figure><p>Many parents are also finding that their grown children are struggling to launch into independence. It’s an increasingly common story: a child goes off to college and, upon graduation, is unable to find steady employment. In such instances, a frequent outcome is for the child to return home, becoming a “boomerang kid.” The <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-boomerang-generation" data-term="boomerang-generation" data-original-title="">boomerang generation</a>, as the phenomenon has come to be known, refers to young adults, mostly between the ages of 25 and 34, who return home to live with their parents while they strive for stability in their lives—often in terms of finances, living arrangements, and sometimes romantic relationships. These boomerang kids can be both good and bad for families. Within American families, 48% of boomerang kids report having paid rent to their parents, and 89% say they help out with household expenses—a win for everyone (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-39" data-reference="39" data-original-title="">Parker, 2012</a>). On the other hand, 24% of boomerang kids report that returning home hurts their relationship with their parents (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-39" data-reference="39" data-original-title="">Parker, 2012</a>). For better or for worse, the number of children returning home has been increasing around the world.</p><p>In addition to middle-aged parents spending more time, money, and energy taking care of their adult children, they are also increasingly taking care of their own aging and ailing parents. Middle-aged people in this set of circumstances are commonly referred to as the <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-sandwich-generation" data-term="sandwich-generation" data-original-title="">sandwich generation</a> (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-20" data-reference="20" data-original-title="">Dukhovnov &amp; Zagheni, 2015</a>). Of course, cultural norms and practices again come into play. In some Asian and Hispanic cultures, the expectation is that adult children are supposed to take care of aging parents and parents-in-law. In other Western cultures—cultures that emphasize individuality and self-sustainability—the expectation has historically been that elders either <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-age-in-place" data-term="age-in-place" data-original-title="">age in place</a>, modifying their home and receiving services to allow them to continue to live independently, or enter long-term care facilities. However, given financial constraints, many families find themselves taking in and caring for their aging parents, increasing the number of <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-multigenerational-homes" data-term="multigenerational-homes" data-original-title="">multigenerational homes</a> around the world.</p><h1 id="family-issues-and-considerations">Family Issues and Considerations</h1><h2 id="divorce">Divorce</h2><p>Divorce refers to the legal dissolution of a marriage. Depending on societal factors, divorce may be more or less of an option for married couples. Despite popular belief, divorce rates in the United States actually declined for many years during the 1980s and 1990s, and only just recently started to climb back up—landing at just below 50% of marriages ending in divorce today (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-31" data-reference="31" data-original-title="">Marriage &amp; Divorce, 2016</a>); however, it should be noted that divorce rates increase for each subsequent marriage, and there is considerable debate about the exact divorce rate. Are there specific factors that can predict divorce? Are certain types of people or certain types of relationships more or less at risk for breaking up? Indeed, there are several factors that appear to be either risk factors or protective factors. </p><p>Pursuing education decreases the risk of divorce. So too does waiting until we are older to marry. Likewise, if our parents are still married we are less likely to divorce. Factors that increase our risk of divorce include having a child before marriage and living with multiple partners before marriage, known as serial cohabitation (cohabitation with one’s expected martial partner does not appear to have the same effect). And, of course, societal and religious attitudes must also be taken into account. In societies that are more accepting of divorce, divorce rates tend to be higher. Likewise, in religions that are less accepting of divorce, divorce rates tend to be lower. See Lyngstad &amp; Jalovaara (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-28" data-reference="28" data-original-title="">2010</a>) for a more thorough discussion of divorce risk.</p><figure data-align="full"><img loading="lazy" title="Protective and risk factors for divorce summarized from the text." src="https://nobaproject.com/images/shared/images/000/002/033/original.jpg" alt="Protective and risk factors for divorce summarized from the text." data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Table 3: Divorce Factors</figcaption></figure><p>If a couple does divorce, there are specific considerations they should take into account to help their children cope. Parents should reassure their children that both parents will continue to love them and that the divorce is in no way the children’s fault. Parents should also encourage open communication with their children and be careful not to bias them against their “ex” or use them as a means of hurting their “ex” (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-16" data-reference="16" data-original-title="">Denham, 2013</a>; <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-24" data-reference="24" data-original-title="">Harvey &amp; Fine, 2004</a>; Pescosoido, 2013).</p><h2 id="abuse">Abuse</h2><p>Abuse can occur in multiple forms and across all family relationships. Breiding, Basile, Smith, Black, &amp; Mahendra (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-9" data-reference="9" data-original-title="">2015</a>) define the forms of abuse as:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-physical-abuse" data-term="physical-abuse" data-original-title="">Physical abuse</a></strong>, the use of intentional physical force to cause harm.

Such abuse is often referred to as sexual assault or rape. A marital relationship does not grant anyone the right to demand sex or sexual activity from anyone, even a spouse;</li><li><strong><a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-psychological-abuse" data-term="psychological-abuse" data-original-title="">Psychological abuse</a></strong>, aggressive behavior that is intended to control someone else. Such abuse can include threats of physical or sexual abuse, manipulation, bullying, and stalking.</li></ul><p>Abuse between partners is referred to as <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-intimate-partner-violence" data-term="intimate-partner-violence" data-original-title="">intimate partner violence</a>; however, such abuse can also occur between a parent and child (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-child-abuse" data-term="child-abuse" data-original-title="">child abuse</a>), adult children and their aging parents (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-elder-abuse" data-term="elder-abuse" data-original-title="">elder abuse</a>), and even between siblings. </p><p>The most common form of abuse between parents and children is actually that of neglect. <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-neglect" data-term="neglect" data-original-title="">Neglect</a> refers to a family’s failure to provide for a child’s basic physical, emotional, medical, or educational needs (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-17" data-reference="17" data-original-title="">DePanfilis, 2006</a>). Harry Potter’s aunt and uncle, as well as Cinderella’s stepmother, could all be prosecuted for neglect in the real world.</p><p>Abuse is a complex issue, especially within families. There are many reasons people become abusers: poverty, stress, and substance abuse are common characteristics shared by abusers, although abuse can happen in any family. There are also many reasons adults stay in abusive relationships: (a) <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-learned-helplessness" data-term="learned-helplessness" data-original-title="">learned helplessness</a> (the abused person believing he or she has no control over the situation); (b) the belief that the abuser can/will change; (c) shame, guilt, self-blame, and/or fear; and (d) economic dependence. All of these factors can play a role.</p><p>Children who experience abuse may “act out” or otherwise respond in a variety of unhealthful ways. These include acts of self-destruction, withdrawal, and aggression, as well as struggles with depression, anxiety, and academic performance. Researchers have found that abused children’s brains may produce higher levels of stress hormones. These hormones can lead to decreased brain development, lower stress thresholds, suppressed immune responses, and lifelong difficulties with learning and memory (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-36" data-reference="36" data-original-title="">Middlebrooks &amp; Audage, 2008</a>).</p><h2 id="adoption">Adoption</h2><p>Divorce and abuse are important concerns, but not all family hurdles are negative. One example of a positive family issue is adoption. <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-adoption" data-term="adoption" data-original-title="">Adoption</a> has long historical roots (it is even mentioned in the Bible) and involves taking in and raising someone else’s child legally as one’s own. Becoming a parent is one of the most fulfilling things a person can do (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-22" data-reference="22" data-original-title="">Gallup &amp; Newport, 1990</a>), but even with modern reproductive technologies, not all couples who would like to have children (which is still most) are able to. For these families, adoption often allows them to feel whole—by completing their family.</p><p>In 2013, in the United States, there were over 100,000 children in <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#vocabulary-foster-care" data-term="foster-care" data-original-title="">foster care</a> (where children go when their biological families are unable to adequately care for them) available for adoption (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-47" data-reference="47" data-original-title="">Soronen, 2013</a>). In total, about 2% of the U.S. child population is adopted, either through foster care or through private domestic or international adoption (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-1" data-reference="1" data-original-title="">Adopted Children, 2012</a>). Adopting a child from the foster care system is relatively inexpensive, costing $0-$2,500, with many families qualifying for state-subsidized support (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-47" data-reference="47" data-original-title="">Soronen, 2013</a>). </p><figure data-align="left"><img loading="lazy" title="A mother and two adopted daughters." src="https://nobaproject.com/images/shared/images/000/002/495/original.jpg" alt="A mother and two adopted daughters." data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Adoption is an important option for creating or expanding a family. Foster care adoptions and international adoptions are both common.

In the United States, between 1999 and 2014, 256,132 international adoptions occurred, with the largest number of children coming from China (73,672) and Russia (46,113) (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-26" data-reference="26" data-original-title="">Intercountry Adoption, 2016</a>). People in the United States, Spain, France, Italy, and Canada adopt the largest numbers of children (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-45" data-reference="45" data-original-title="">Selman, 2009</a>). More recently, however, international adoptions have begun to decrease. One significant complication is that each country has its own set of requirements for adoption, as does each country from which an adopted child originates. As such, the adoption process can vary greatly, especially in terms of cost, and countries are able to police who adopts their children. For example, single, obese, or over-50 individuals are not allowed to adopt a child from China (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-family#reference-4" data-reference="4" data-original-title="">Bartholet, 2007</a>).</p><p>Regardless of why a family chooses to adopt, traits such as flexibility, patience, strong problem-solving skills, and a willingness to identify local community resources are highly favorable for the prospective parents to possess. Additionally, it may be helpful for adoptive parents to recognize that they do not have to be “perfect” parents as long as they are loving and willing to meet the unique challenges their adopted child may pose.</p><h1 id="happy-healthy-families">Happy Healthy Families</h1><p>Our families play a crucial role in our overall development and happiness.
